# StravaPi

A Strava data visualizer for Raspberry Pi.

## What does this do?

This will visualize your Strava running stats on a Raspberry Pi, equipped with a Scroll pHAT LED display. Right now, the LED displays two data points: 1) total miles run since the beginning of the week and 2) the number of days remaining until a user-defined date.
